# messenger

Welcome to my app.

To launch, just run the following from the root of this directory:

```bash
cd messenger-code && npm run dev
# or
cd messenger-code && yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the messenger.

The app comes preloaded with two users, but you can add your own senders and recipients. Your messages will be saved on your machine and will persist across browser sessions.
